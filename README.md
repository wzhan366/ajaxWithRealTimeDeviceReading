##What's ajax

>Ajax (also AJAX; /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML)[1][2][3] is a set of web development techniques using many web >technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a >server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data >interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content >dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.[4] In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to >the advantages of being native to JavaScript.[5]

>Ajax is not a technology, but a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM >is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display – and allow the user to interact with – the information presented. JavaScript and the >XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.
